<h2 style="color: purple;">The Llama </h2> 
<p style="color:grey;"> 
    Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When
    she spies a patch of them on a web page,
    she will eat them like sweets, licking her 
    lips as she goes.

<h2 style="color:purple">The Anaconda</h2>

<p style="color:grey"> 
    The crafty anaconda likkes to slither 
    around the page, travelling rapidly by way
    of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
